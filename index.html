									<h1>Identity Theft</h1>

								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Take it seriously!</h2>
									<p><b>Your personal information is at risk</b> in more ways than you may know. Here, you can learn about various identity theft techniques, along with many preemptive steps you can take to minimize your risk.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Be aware</h2>
									<p>Knowledge is the best tool available for allowing you to avoid becoming an identity theft victim. The tabs on the left contain information about some of the most prominent types of online threats to your security.</p>

									<h1>What is phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>Phishing is the act of forging parts or the entirety of a legitimate website, email or other communication in order to glean information from you, the end user.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>What do phishers hope to gain?</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Authentication information</b> that can then be later used to alter and login to your online accounts for websites.</br></li>
											<li><b>Account numbers and PINs</b> for your banks and credit cards are very popular targets, as they allow direct access to your finances.</br></li>
											<li><b>Personal information</b> from social media sites and your email that may otherwise be restricted to only your friends can be used to delve further into your personal life.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>What can you lose?</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Your anonymity</b> is in short supply these days since the web is increasingly connected with your personal life. Unauthorized people viewing your personal information at will and creating or altering your online persona has more real-world effects and consequences than ever before.</br></li>
											<li><b>Credit score points</b> are what define your value and safety to creditors. As soon as any transactions made by the phishers are refused due to the low funds in your account, you can say hello to your new, lower, credit score which comes complete with benefits like being refused credit extensions and being given higher rates.</br></li>
											<li><b>Time</b> is the most limited and valuable resource any of us has. It can be much better spent doing something productive or enjoyable than clearing up false transactions made by someone else.</li>
											<li><b>Money,</b> it's what you need to pay your bills, invest in your future, and have some fun here and there. You don't need to spend it on financing a fourth Ferrari for someone who stole your resources.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Ways to minimize potential losses and damage:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<b>Unique passwords</b> for each website you use will prevent your stolen credentials from one site to be used to access other sites. It can be complicated to remember so many different passwords, so password management software such as KeePass is highly recommended.

									<h1>What is website phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Website phishing is the act of forging parts or the entirety of a legitimate website in order to glean information from you, the end user.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>How you can avoid and identify forged or altered websites:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Incorrect URLs</b> are the easiest way to spot forged sites, and are also the easiest way for phishers to setup forged pages. Double check what you type into the address bar of your browser, and when you click on links that lead you to sites where you login, make sure that the link takes you to the correct site.</br></li>
											<li><b>Unsecured URLs</b> on a site that should be secure, such as web stores, banks, or any other place where you enter sensitive information are an excellent indicator that where you ended up is not where you want to be. Look at the URL, and if it begins with "https://", you're in good shape. URLs starting with "http://" (note the lack of the "s") means that your connection is not encrypted.</br></li>
											<li><b>Altered site designs and new popups</b> can sometimes be an indicator that something is amiss. If a website has been compromised by an attacker, they may add new items to take advantage of your implicit trust in the website. Even if the majority of the website is legitimate and secure content, scripts and content added by a malicious user can still steal your information.</li>
											<li><b>Invalid certificates</b> are an excellent indicator of a malicious site. Modern web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome have an indicator to the left of the url that you can click on to display information about the site's certificate and encryption status. If a site that you enter sensitive information into has an invalid certificate or allows unencrypted connections to take place, you should ask yourself how willing you are for the information you enter to be stolen.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Safeguards against site phishing and forgery:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Use secure and up to date web browsers</b>to ensure that lists of valid certificates are installed and that vulnerabilities in the browser are patched and kept to a minimum.</br></li>
											<li><b>Do not implicitly trust links</b>because they say they take you somewhere. Click on this link: <a href = "www.wikipedia.org">https://www.bankofamerica.com/</a>. Notice how it took you somewhere completely different (and safe in this case) even though the displayed URL is the correct one for Bank of America. Links like that in a malicious setting won't take you somewhere so benign.</br></li>

									<h1>What is email phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Email phishing occurs when a malicious party sends you an email with false information in the hopes that you will respond and provide them with inside, personal information
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>How you can avoid and identify email phishing:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Create an alternate email address</b> for when you sign up or register for sites that may not have your best interests in mind.</br></li>
											<li><b>Verify the sender information</b> in emails you receive; especially if there are attachments or if they contain outside links to unknown websites.</br></li>
											<li><b>Go directly to websites</b> rather than clicking on links. Sometimes senders will have long links, and you may not be able to identify their authenticity. Instead, go to the site by searching for it on google so you can avoid typing mistakes into the address bar of your browser.</li>
											<li><b>Be wary of any attachments</b> regardless of whether or not you are expecting them. Be especially careful of easily exploitable items like executables and java files.</li>
											<li><b>Look for incongruencies</b> in information or presentations. If your english teacher suddenly develops horrendous grammar skills, or your 15 year old sister emails you regarding needing money to escape the country before assassins find her, you should at least give their requests a second thought.</li>
											<li><b>Use an email provider that has good spam filters.</b> Most email providers today do an excellent job at filtering out spam, but if you've been having problems recently, consider moving to a provider such as Google that will filter out spam and do a great job of it.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Common emails to keep an eye out for:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>No, today really isn't your lucky day</b> even though you've managed to win a multi-million dollar lottery that only drew three winners. Did I mention you won it twice?</br></li>
											<li><b>The royal families and elite citizens of foreign nations don't need you</b> to move their money or collect their recently deceased, long lost uncle's inheritance for them. That's what armored trucks and banks are for. Your "Student Plus" account will be drained before you know it, or the FBI will come knocking since you just volunteered to become a money mule when you sent them your routing number, name, address and account number.</br></li>
											<li><b>Please respond with your credentials</b> such as login information, bank information or PIN, so that the sender may better service you by snatching your money and account. Banks and other companies will not ask for these details by email; be very cautious and report any incidences like these should they occur. Especially if it appears the institution itself is sending these messages.</br></li>

									<h1>Recovery</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Despite even the best precautions, no system is perfect, and even if it's no fault of your own, your information can still find its way into the hands of a malicious person. When this happens, you may not find out for days or even months afterwards, so once you're aware of the breach, you should take care of matters as quickly as possible. There are two places in your life you need to inspect; your financial records and your computer.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Finance</h2><br/>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Check your credit report</b> using one of the many sites available online such as <a href= "https://www.annualcreditreport.com/"> www.annualcreditreport.com</a>. If any new accounts have been opened using your information, they will appear here. Consider this the first step in fixing the problem. </br></li>
											<li><b>Investigate the businesses you have had transactions with.</b> Check with the Better Business Bureau, and run a google search to see if there have been other reported incidences with the site in question.</br></li>
											<li><b>Cancel any credit or debit cards being abused.</b> Because of a skimmer or a leaked database of information, your card details can be abused so that thieves can use the card online. In this case, immediately call your bank or credit card company and make them aware of any false charges, and then have the card canceled.</br></li>
											<li><b>Place freezes and fraud alerts on your credit rating.</b> Doing this puts you in the loop when your credit score and reports are accessed, which allows you more control of what happens with your name. The downside is you will have to go through extra steps to open new lines of credit, but your financial wellbeing will be greatly improved. Depending on where you live, freezes may cost money.</br></li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Computer</h2><br/>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Install an antivirus program.</b> Much of the information stolen in today's world comes from malware that has found its way onto your computer. If you feel confident in your abilities to avoid future infections, a quick sweep of Comodo Clean Essentials is your best bet at removing any threats currently on your hardware. To protect yourself in the future, install AVG Anti-Virus Free 2012. Both of these products are free, readily available, and used daily by many.</br> </li>
											<li><b>Clear your cookies</b> to make sure no passwords, login information or other credentials are being stored on your computer. You will benefit from regularly cleaning these.</br></li>
											<li><b>Disable password saving</b> for the same reason you clean your cookie cache. If someone else has access to your computer either physically or remotely they can login to sites automatically if your browser saves passwords, even though the stored passwords are encrypted.</br></li>
											<li><b>Reformat or revert to a saved operating system state.</b> If all else fails, this can sometimes be the only way to make sure that your system is clean. It will take some time to get everything set back up, but it is guaranteed to make sure there are no compromised files on your system.</br></li>
