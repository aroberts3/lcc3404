									<h1>Identity Theft</h1>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>Perhaps you have seen one of our flyers posted around the Georgia Tech campus by the ATMs or computer labs, or maybe Google or a friend suggested this site to you. Regardless of how you arrived, explore the site to obtain some great information about how identity theft affects you, and how you can make some minor adjustments to your daily life around campus to keep yourself safe. Because if you're not careful and your identity gets nabbed, someone else can quite easily become you, and none of us wants that.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>In order to help you, we have compiled information that will help you keep your identity and resources safe, on the important topics such as:
										<ul>
											<li><b>Phishing</b>, including details on both emails and websites</li>
											<li><b>Malware</b> and what it can do to you and your computer</li>
											<li><b>ATM Fraud:</b> How to spot and avoid it</li>
											<li><b>What to do</b> in the event fraud happens to you.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								
								<div class="span4">
									<p>Don't waste your valuable time searching for each individual topic when you can have it all right here, and brought to you by your peers at this school who live each day dealing with the same threats and concerns as you.</p>

									<h1>What is phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>Phishing is the act of forging parts or the entirety of a legitimate website, email or other communication in order to glean information from you, the end user.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>What do phishers hope to gain?</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Authentication information</b> that can then be later used to alter and login to your online accounts for websites.</br></li>
											<li><b>Account numbers and PINs</b> for your banks and credit cards are very popular targets, as they allow direct access to your finances.</br></li>
											<li><b>Personal information</b> from social media sites and your email that may otherwise be restricted to only your friends can be used to delve further into your personal life.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>What can you lose?</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Your anonymity</b> is in short supply these days since the web is increasingly connected with your personal life. Unauthorized people viewing your personal information at will and creating or altering your online persona has more real-world effects and consequences than ever before.</br></li>
											<li><b>Credit score points</b> are what define your value and safety to creditors. As soon as any transactions made by the phishers are refused due to the low funds in your account, you can say hello to your new, lower, credit score which comes complete with benefits like being refused credit extensions and being given higher rates.</br></li>
											<li><b>Time</b> is the most limited and valuable resource any of us has. It can be much better spent doing something productive or enjoyable than clearing up false transactions made by someone else.</li>
											<li><b>Money,</b> it's what you need to pay your bills, invest in your future, and have some fun here and there. You don't need to spend it on financing a fourth Ferrari for someone who stole your resources.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Ways to minimize potential losses and damage:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<b>Unique passwords</b> for each website you use will prevent your stolen credentials from one site to be used to access other sites. It can be complicated to remember so many different passwords, so password management software such as KeePass is highly recommended.

									<h1>What is website phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Website phishing is the act of forging parts or the entirety of a legitimate website in order to glean information from you, the end user.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>How you can avoid and identify forged or altered websites:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Incorrect URLs</b> are the easiest way to spot forged sites, and are also the easiest way for phishers to setup forged pages. Double check what you type into the address bar of your browser, and when you click on links that lead you to sites where you login, make sure that the link takes you to the correct site.</br></li>
											<li><b>Unsecured URLs</b> on a site that should be secure, such as web stores, banks, or any other place where you enter sensitive information are an excellent indicator that where you ended up is not where you want to be. Look at the URL, and if it begins with "https://", you're in good shape. URLs starting with "http://" (note the lack of the "s") means that your connection is not encrypted.</br></li>
											<li><b>Altered site designs and new popups</b> can sometimes be an indicator that something is amiss. If a website has been compromised by an attacker, they may add new items to take advantage of your implicit trust in the website. Even if the majority of the website is legitimate and secure content, scripts and content added by a malicious user can still steal your information.</li>
											<li><b>Invalid certificates</b> are an excellent indicator of a malicious site. Modern web browsers such as Firefox and Chrome have an indicator to the left of the url that you can click on to display information about the site's certificate and encryption status. If a site that you enter sensitive information into has an invalid certificate or allows unencrypted connections to take place, you should ask yourself how willing you are for the information you enter to be stolen.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Safeguards against site phishing and forgery:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Use secure and up to date web browsers</b>to ensure that lists of valid certificates are installed and that vulnerabilities in the browser are patched and kept to a minimum.</br></li>
											<li><b>Do not implicitly trust links</b>because they say they take you somewhere. Click on this link: <a href = "www.wikipedia.org">https://www.bankofamerica.com/</a>. Notice how it took you somewhere completely different (and safe in this case) even though the displayed URL is the correct one for Bank of America. Links like that in a malicious setting won't take you somewhere so benign.</br></li>

									<h1>What is email phishing?</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Email phishing occurs when a malicious party sends you an email with false information in the hopes that you will respond and provide them with inside, personal information
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>How you can avoid and identify email phishing:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Create an alternate email address</b> for when you sign up or register for sites that may not have your best interests in mind.</br></li>
											<li><b>Verify the sender information</b> in emails you receive; especially if there are attachments or if they contain outside links to unknown websites.</br></li>
											<li><b>Go directly to websites</b> rather than clicking on links. Sometimes senders will have long links, and you may not be able to identify their authenticity. Instead, go to the site by searching for it on google so you can avoid typing mistakes into the address bar of your browser.</li>
											<li><b>Be wary of any attachments</b> regardless of whether or not you are expecting them. Be especially careful of easily exploitable items like executables and java files.</li>
											<li><b>Look for incongruencies</b> in information or presentations. If your english teacher suddenly develops horrendous grammar skills, or your 15 year old sister emails you regarding needing money to escape the country before assassins find her, you should at least give their requests a second thought.</li>
											<li><b>Use an email provider that has good spam filters.</b> Most email providers today do an excellent job at filtering out spam, but if you've been having problems recently, consider moving to a provider such as Google that will filter out spam and do a great job of it.</li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Common emails to keep an eye out for:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>No, today really isn't your lucky day</b> even though you've managed to win a multi-million dollar lottery that only drew three winners. Did I mention you won it twice?</br></li>
											<li><b>The royal families and elite citizens of foreign nations don't need you</b> to move their money or collect their recently deceased, long lost uncle's inheritance for them. That's what armored trucks and banks are for. Your "Student Plus" account will be drained before you know it, or the FBI will come knocking since you just volunteered to become a money mule when you sent them your routing number, name, address and account number.</br></li>
											<li><b>Please respond with your credentials</b> such as login information, bank information or PIN, so that the sender may better service you by snatching your money and account. Banks and other companies will not ask for these details by email; be very cautious and report any incidences like these should they occur. Especially if it appears the institution itself is sending these messages.</br></li>

									<h1>Malware</h1><br/>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>Malware: It's bad and someone wants it on your computer, but you definitely don't. There are a few overarching types of malware, but the goal of them all is the same. Money is the name of the game. Whoever is in charge of it wants to make a profit, and you're the person that's going to be paying up. As with anything, be aware of where your files are coming from, and what information they may have access to. The people who create malware are a motivated and creative group, and it is only a matter of time until they find their way around safeguards put in place to protect you, so the best method is to protect yourself. Awareness and prevention are the key ways to do this. So you might be wondering, how did you pick it up?</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>The most common ways malware is acquired are as follows:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Email attachments</b> might be a new spreadsheet or pdf from your boss, but make sure you recognize and trust who sent it, because those are common carriers of malware.</br></li>
											<li><b>Infected downloads</b>that you got from a website or a P2P program often come in as executables, though it is possible to infect even pictures, audio files, and videos. Be careful, and scan a file with an anti-virus program if you're not sure of the source.</br></li>
											<li><b>Compromised sites</b>often host malware through the efforts of hackers who have planted it there. Sites are sometimes setup with the sole purpose of infecting your devices.</br></li>
											<li><b>Unpatched computers</b>that are connected to a network are vulnerable to infection from worms and viruses which propagate autonomously.</br></li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>Keeping your software patched and exercising good common sense will prevent most attempts to compromise your computer. Once your computer has been compromised, anything and everything you do or have on your computer can be accessed or altered. All modern operating systems have built in firewalls, which block external attempts to access your computer. However, this will do little good if your computer has already been compromised, because there's an excellent chance that the infection will be able to bypass the firewall. Because of this, it's an excellent practice to anti-malware software on hand to scan for and remove infections as needed. <a href ="http://www.comodo.com/home/internet-security/anti-malware.php">Comodo</a> and <a href ="http://free.avg.com/us-en/homepage">AVG</a> both make excellent free products to fill this need.</p>

								<div class="span4">

									<h1>ATM Fraud and Theft</h1><br/>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>
										ATM Fraud is the silent killer among identity theft threats. You use a machine that you expect is perfectly secure, but unbeknownst to you, someone else has altered the machine for the sole purpose of snatching details about your bank account. The risks associated with this are not as extreme as complete identity theft, but having these details stolen gives malicious parties near immediate access to any money associated with your card.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<p>
										As college students in this generation, we spend much of our money online. For many of us, using ATMs is still a necessity, and once you factor in scanning your cards at gas pumps, none of us are safe from the threat of skimmers and ATM fraud. Education about this persistent threat will go a long way in ensuring that our resources stay secure, and that college isn't made harder than it needs to be because that ATM you took money out of was compromised.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Some tips that you can use:</br></h2>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Cover the pad</b> when entering your PIN. Skimmed numbers are useless without a PIN.</br></li>
											<li><b>Check the machine</b> for any incongruencies such as:
												<ul>
													<li>Different color plastics</li>
													<li>Parts that look altered or easily detachable</li>
													<li>Any pinholes or camera-like devices pointed at the keypad</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li><b>Be aware</b> of your environment and follow your gut feeling.</br></li>
										</ul>
									</p>

										Brian Krebs, a professional information security researcher, has spent much time tracking down ATM fraudsters, stories of ATM fraud, and explains in great detail the things to watch out for and be careful of when using ATMs in order to maintain your privacy and the integrity of your account credentials. Besides just covering ATM theft, he continuously acts as an investigative reporter, often talking to and obtaining details from both law enforcement and the masterminds behind ATM alteration and debit card theft rings.

									<h1>Recovery</h1><br/>
									<p>
										Despite even the best precautions, no system is perfect, and even if it's no fault of your own, your information can still find its way into the hands of a malicious person. When this happens, you may not find out for days or even months afterwards, so once you're aware of the breach, you should take care of matters as quickly as possible. There are two places in your life you need to inspect; your financial records and your computer.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Finance</h2><br/>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Check your credit report</b> using one of the many sites available online such as <a href= "https://www.annualcreditreport.com/"> www.annualcreditreport.com</a>. If any new accounts have been opened using your information, they will appear here. Consider this the first step in fixing the problem. </br></li>
											<li><b>Investigate the businesses you have had transactions with.</b> Check with the Better Business Bureau, and run a google search to see if there have been other reported incidences with the site in question.</br></li>
											<li><b>Cancel any credit or debit cards being abused.</b> Because of a skimmer or a leaked database of information, your card details can be abused so that thieves can use the card online. In this case, immediately call your bank or credit card company and make them aware of any false charges, and then have the card canceled.</br></li>
											<li><b>Place freezes and fraud alerts on your credit rating.</b> Doing this puts you in the loop when your credit score and reports are accessed, which allows you more control of what happens with your name. The downside is you will have to go through extra steps to open new lines of credit, but your financial wellbeing will be greatly improved. Depending on where you live, freezes may cost money.</br></li>
										</ul>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="span4">
									<h2>Computer</h2><br/>
									<p>
										<ul>
											<li><b>Install an antivirus program.</b> Much of the information stolen in today's world comes from malware that has found its way onto your computer. If you feel confident in your abilities to avoid future infections, a quick sweep of Comodo Clean Essentials is your best bet at removing any threats currently on your hardware. To protect yourself in the future, install AVG Anti-Virus Free 2012. Both of these products are free, readily available, and used daily by many.</br> </li>
											<li><b>Clear your cookies</b> to make sure no passwords, login information or other credentials are being stored on your computer. You will benefit from regularly cleaning these.</br></li>
											<li><b>Disable password saving</b> for the same reason you clean your cookie cache. If someone else has access to your computer either physically or remotely they can login to sites automatically if your browser saves passwords, even though the stored passwords are encrypted.</br></li>
											<li><b>Reformat or revert to a saved operating system state.</b> If all else fails, this can sometimes be the only way to make sure that your system is clean. It will take some time to get everything set back up, but it is guaranteed to make sure there are no compromised files on your system.</br></li>
